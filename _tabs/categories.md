# Hello! I‚Äôm Purvi Jain 

I‚Äôm a technologist by training, a philosopher by calling, and an environmental activist at heart. My work centers around the intersection of digital systems, ethics, and social change. Raised in India, I've traversed an unusual path: from programming in computer science to probing philosophical dilemmas. My story begins with lines of code-lessons in logic, structure, problem-solving‚Äîand ends (so far) in classrooms and public spaces, asking much bigger questions: What kind of society should digital systems build? Who benefits when identity is tracked or anonymized? And how can technology be shaped responsibly, for all?

As someone trained in both computer science and philosophy, I find my voice in asking not only ‚ÄúWhat does this system do?‚Äù but also ‚ÄúWhat does this system mean, and what values does it enact?‚Äù During undergraduate years, I built tools and solved technical problems. But when I stepped back to ask, ‚ÄúFor whom? At what cost?‚Äù I realized that meaning matters no less than functionality. This dual fluency: technical and normative, remains central to my work. It‚Äôs why I moved to pursue a Master‚Äôs in philosophy after my IT degree, and it‚Äôs what drives my passion for projects like Self‚ÄëSovereign Identity, algorithmic ethics, and the politics of digital infrastructure.

## Why I Do What I Do

I‚Äôm drawn to questions at the intersection of tech, ethics, and power. How do we build systems that enhance agency? What are our obligations as designers and thinkers?

My background allows me to translate code into ethical insight‚Äîand vice versa.
