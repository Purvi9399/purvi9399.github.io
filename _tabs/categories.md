# About Me

Hi! I’m Purvi Jain, a passionate explorer at the intersection of AI, ethics, and critical inquiry.

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and a Master’s in Philosophy from the University of Glasgow. My journey bridges two worlds: the logic of computation and the depth of ethical reasoning.

So far, I’ve...

- Founded the GreenBeans Society, a youth e-waste recycling NGO.
- Coordinated TEDx events at NIT Raipur as Head Organizer.
- Mentored students at IntoUniversity (including students with ADHD and autism).
- Worked with Quantum Computing India as a Community Builder.

This space  *AI Ethics Explorer* is where I grow projects, write essays, and experiment with ideas at the bleeding edge of technology and philosophy.
