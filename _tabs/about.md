Hi, I'm **Purvi Jain** — a researcher working at the intersection of technology, ethics, and society.

I created **AI Ethics Explorer** to document my learning, build mini-projects, and reflect on the ethical dimensions of AI.

My academic path blends a BTech in Computer Science with an MSc in Philosophy. I'm preparing for a PhD in AI ethics, and this space is where I think aloud — through code, questions, and curiosity.

Feel free to explore my [Projects](/projects/) or check out the [Blog](/posts/) to follow my journey.
