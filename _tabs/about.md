Hi, I'm Purvi Jain — a researcher at the intersection of technology, ethics, and society.

I created AI Ethics Explorer to document my learning, build mini-projects, and reflect on the ethical dimensions of AI. My academic journey blends a BTech in Computer Science with an MSc in Philosophy, and I’m working toward a PhD in AI ethics.

This space is where I think aloud — through code, questions, and curiosity.
