Hello! 👋 I'm Purvi Jain, and this is my space to explore the ethics of artificial intelligence — one mini-project at a time.

This blog will include:
- 🛠️ Small tools and code experiments
- ✍️ Essays on ethics, fairness, and governance
- 🧠 Reflections as I prepare for a PhD in AI Ethics

Stay tuned!
